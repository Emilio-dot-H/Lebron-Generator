# Lebron-Generator
This is a small project in large part dedicated to the r/nba community. This is meant to be taken as light, fun, and in good spirit. Lebron James is a high-level athlete and a bonafide superstar in the NBA. The play on words originated as a meme where you take the first part of Jame's ("Le") name and attach it to a word of your choosing.   While this is a project to refine my coding skills, I look to clean it up and add more feature to the applications.  Upcoming features that I would like to incorporate is a 'Random' feature as well as 'Celebrity/Famous People' feature.
